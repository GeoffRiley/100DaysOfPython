# Day 25: 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020
Try out awesome library [_PythonRobotics_](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics) 
—This is a compilation of various robotics algorithms with visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.x (2.7 is not supported)
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/index.html)

No installation for _PythonRobotics_, rather a copy of the GitHub repository.

## Notes
This is a **huge** collection of algorithms associated with robotics.

## Outcome
I spent far too long looking through the code… the documentation is very well
crafted with animated gifs demonstrating the progress of the various algorithms
graphically as well as good clear descriptions of those algorithms.

## Comments
I have been involved with autonomous robotics with Raspberry Pi's in the past
and a number of the algorithms are very familiar: I do wish that I had all this
before though.

Excellent library.
