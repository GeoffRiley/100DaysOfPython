# Day 5: 5<sup>th</sup> January 2020
Try out awesome library [_django-wordpress_](https://github.com/istrategylabs/django-wordpress) 
â€”WordPress models and views for Django. 

## Requirements
- a website running the [WordPress](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/) system
- the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) `pip install Django==3.0.2`
(additionally caused the installation of _sqlparse_, _pytz_, _asgiref_)

`pip install the-real-django-wordpress`

## Notes
In order to use this library it is necessary to have a working WordPress blog
with the Django api connector, none of which I have readily at hand.

## Outcome
Too much time spent on installing Wordpress and Django, let alone getting
them working together 

## Comments
At a double disadvantage having no experience with either WordPress nor 
Django installations made the exercise of examining this particular library
rather difficult.

However, the attempt to install these packages has led to me having a working
Django framework installation that will no-doubt become useful later on.
