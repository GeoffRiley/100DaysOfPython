# Day 11: 11<sup>th</sup> January 2020
Try out awesome library [_alipay_](https://github.com/lxneng/alipay) 
—Unofficial Alipay API for Python.

## Requirements
`pip install alipay`

## Notes
Fist off… I'd never heard of _Alipay_. Apparently it's the Chinese 
equivalent of _PayPal_, but it works differently by operating as an 
escrow agent rather than purely a transaction intermediary.

_Alipay_ is to _Alibaba_ as _PayPal_ is to _eBay_—more or less.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alipay) _Alipay_
overtook _PayPal_ as the world's largest mobile payment platform in 2013.

## Outcome
The code appears to be well written and seems compatible with both 
Python 2 and Python 3, but it does require account keys being created
for access to the API.

## Comments
Having no suitable accounts with which to try this out, as well as not
wishing to create an unnecessary financial link, I have not tried this
library at all.
