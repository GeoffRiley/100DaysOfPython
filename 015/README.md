# Day 15: 15<sup>th</sup> January 2020
Try out awesome library [_django-countries_](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries) 
â€”A Django app that provides country choices for use with forms, flag icons static files, and 
a country field for models.

## Requirements
- Django framework

`pip install django-countries`

## Notes
Another Django application.

The purpose of this one is to provide a method of entering countries into
forms. It has a highly configurable setup that includes displaying 
national flags alongside selections, restricting selections, pre-selecting
countries for top of selection list and so on.

## Outcome

## Comments
As stated on [day 11](../011), I'm skipping libraries that require 
specific server set ups and performing another task instead.
