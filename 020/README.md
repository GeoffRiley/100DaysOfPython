# Day 20: 20<sup>th</sup> January 2020
Try out awesome library [_jinja-assets-compressor_](https://github.com/jaysonsantos/jinja-assets-compressor) 
â€”A Jinja extension to compile and compress your assets.

## Requirements
- Needs a working Jinja or Flask server
- Appropriate resource compression tools accessed through `node`

`pip install jac`

## Notes
This package is capable of 'compressing' `JavaScript` and `CSS` through the asset
packages such as `less`, `coffee-script`, and `sass`.

## Outcome
I hadn't come across `Jinja` before, but it is clearly another framework similar
to `Flask` or `Django`. The operation of _jac_ is through the insertion of control
tags in the html source. There have been no updates to the code since September 
2018; but there are PRs outstanding submitted (apparently) by a bot for various
module updates that have been unattended since August 2019.

## Comments
This is another library requiring operating servers and so I'm passing on attempts
to test it out.
