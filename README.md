# 100DaysOfPython
My progress through 100 days of awesome python on https://codechalleng.es/100days

I am spending one hour on each day examining the topic of the day.  I'll see how it goes as to whether I
generate much code or I spend more time reading in that hour: if the latter then I will take more time
afterwards to write up what I have read and learnt.  I am putting a limit on time purely to stop me just
ploughing on for hour after hour playing with a new _toy_… as tends to be my wont. :)
